“Ooh, this is one of those artisan, hand-crafted websites! I’ll have to post this to my Instagram. I once met an old web developer in the south of France who would wash the bytes by hand before uploading them to his server. Said it was a family tradition passed down for generations.” - <a href="https://k1ss.org/testimonials">KISS Linux Testimonial</a>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of developing websites. This website was an exercise in treating web development like the development of C programs and their related tools, which I’m much more familiar with.</p>
<p>Modifying this website only requires editing plaintext Markdown files, a Makefile, and git.</p>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time tinkering with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> previously. It’s a really simple way to just import a theme, write some simple pages in markdown, and you’re set. While I think this is a really good solution for people like me that just want something that looks nice with minimal work, I felt like I didn’t have full control or understanding of various elements. If I’m going to have to dig into the CSS and JavaScript anyway, I’d rather write a worse replacement myself but at least understand it fully.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>In treating the source of this website like the source of a C program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSS is like the header files, it defines some shared parameters to be imported and expanded on elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is like the <code>.c</code> files, the bulk of the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And finally, <code>cmark</code> acts as a compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this familiar setup, of course a <code>Makefile</code> is needed!</p>
<p>The directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>├── Makefile
│
│   # The actual content
├── index.md
├── 404.md
├── Blog
│   ├── {blog}
│   ├──── post.md
│   └──── content
├── Project
│   ├── {project}
│   ├──── post.md
│   └──── content
│
│   # Style
└── style.css</code></pre>
<p>I’ve written the Makefile so that the compiled <code>.html</code> lives in the same space as the source <code>.md</code>. I <del>can’t be bothered to change that</del> decided this was a feature, so everything is <del>entirely unsecured</del> open source. Both the source <code>.md</code> and compiled <code>.html</code>, as well as the entire Makefile can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/jleightcap/jleightcap.github.io">GitHub Pages repo</a>.</p>
<p>To generate the website just requires a <code>make</code> and a super fast compilation. The relevant piece of the Makefile:</p>
<pre><code>%.html: %.md
    cmark -t html --unsafe $^ &gt; $@</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--unsafe</code> cmark flag allows for inline HTML in the source .md files. The <code>sed</code> command prepends each .html file with a link to the source CSS. Think of this as a linker? Idk at this point the metaphor is a little contrived.</p>
