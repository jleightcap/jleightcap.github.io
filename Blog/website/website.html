<h1>Designing a Website Like a C Program</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of developing websites.
This website was an exercise in treating web development like the development of
C programs and their related tools, which I'm much more familiar with.</p>
<p>Modifying this website only requires editing plaintext Markdown files, a Makefile, and
git.</p>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time tinkering with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> previously.
It's a really simple way to just import a theme, write some simple pages in markdown, and you're set.
While I think this is a really good solution for people like me that just want
something that looks nice with minimal work, I felt like I didn't have full
control or understanding of various elements.
If I'm going to have to dig into the CSS and JavaScript anyway, I'd rather write a
worse replacement myself but at least understand it fully.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>In treating the source of this website like the source of a C program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSS is like the header files, it defines some shared parameters to be imported and expanded on elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is like the <code>.c</code> files, the bulk of the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And finally, <code>pandoc</code> acts as a compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this familiar setup, of course a <code>Makefile</code> is needed!</p>
<p>The directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>├── Makefile
│
│   # The actual content
├── index.md
├── Blog
│   └── {blog posts}.md
├── Project
│   └── {project posts}.md
├── Images
│   └── {Images}
│
│   # Style
├── latex.css
└── fonts
    └── {fonts}
</code></pre>
<p>I've written the Makefile so that the compiled <code>.html</code> lives in the same space as the source <code>.md</code>.
I ~~can't be bothered to change that~~ decided this was a feature, so everything is ~~entirely unsecured~~ open source.
Both the source <code>.md</code> and compiled <code>.html</code>, as well as the entire Makefile can
be found at the
<a href="https://github.com/jleightcap/jleightcap.github.io">GitHub Pages repo</a>.</p>
<p>To generate the website just requires a <code>make</code> and a super fast compilation.
The relevant piece of the Makefile:</p>
<pre><code>%.html: %.md
    pandoc -s -c $(CSS) -o $@ $^

Blog/%.html: Blog/%.md
    pandoc -s -c $(BLOGCSS) -o $@ $^

Project/%.html: Project/%.md
    pandoc -s -c $(PROJCSS) -o $@ $^
</code></pre>
<h2>Style, Elements</h2>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>I'm using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css">LaTeX.CSS</a>
here, and think it looks fantstic.
Instead of copying the source here as I've done, a simple <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> works as
well, and may be more elegant for including fonts.
I simply prefer to host the source in the same space as the content.</p>
<p>A minor addition is support for the iconic
&quot;<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>&quot;,
which can be found <a href="http://nitens.org/taraborelli/texlogo">here</a>.
Just make sure to update the font to Latin Modern.</p>
<h2><span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span></h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I didn't want to use any JavaScript on my website.
I'll make an exception for including <a href="%5B200%7Ehttps://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>
because of its comparative simplicity in rendering
<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
natively.</p>
<center>$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \log_b p(x_i)$$</center>
<p>Or inline $\det(\lambda \textbf{I} - \textbf{A}) = 0$, like that.</p>
<p>For this structure, because there is no common <code>header</code> or <code>footer</code>, each <code>.md</code>
file sources the MathJax script only if needed.</p>
<p>The alternative I've considered is using the <code>standalone</code>
<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
documentclass to make a single image for each equation.
This is entirely possible, just diminishes the speed and modularity of writing
a single self-contained Markdown file.</p>
