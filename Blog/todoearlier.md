title: "\"Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier?!\""

A list of random things I wish I had learned about or taken seriously earlier.

# Linux (Broadly)
- Vim. Just as a whole.
I'm legally required to sass Emacs here, but it's a good option too.
After about a month of getting up to speed in vim, you shortly rocket past your old text editing speed and you can't look back to using your mouse like a neanderthal.

- Shell scripting.
The tools can be complicated in and of themselves to learn -- it's easy to copy-paste from SO a `sed` expression and be done, but it's worth it to understand what you're doing and constantly improve your toolbox.
On the other hand, Python is a really good drop-in replacement for shell scripts
if you don't feel like wading through ancient Unix utilities.

## LaTeX
- Making templates. LaTeX is mostly boilerplate, don't bother trying to memorize it.
Spend the upfront time to make some pretty templates and bend those to your needs.
- `siunitx`. Once 'naked' units are pointed out to you, you can't unsee them.
- `vimtex`. Goes hand-in-hand with the benefits of vim.
- `ultisnips` vim plugin. Again, LaTeX is overly verbose.
Trim it down how you like it.
- Generating your own figures (when appropriate).
Learn basic `tikz` and it's applicable to `circuitikz`.
`chemfig` is also great. Any code goes in a `minted` environment.
- Break lines on sentences, especially if using version control.
Breaking at a character limit is okay, but LaTeX lines aren't equivalent to lines of a programming language.

# Life
- Making your own bread. Either you get fantastic bread or tasty failures.
Reach out if you want a splice of my sourdough starter.
- Meal prep. It takes time to plan and a decent chunk of a day, but not having to cook 6/7 days of the week is great when you're busy.
- Don't rely on your memory for menial things.
Make TODO lists, put events in your calendar as soon as they come up, write down that random good idea you had.
Use your brain for things that are important.
