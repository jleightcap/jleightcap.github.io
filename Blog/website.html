<h1 class="title">Why this website looks like the year 2005</h1>
<h2 class="author">Jack Leightcap</h2>
<h3 class="date">April 3, 2020</h3>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time tinkering with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> previously. It's a really simple way to just import a theme, write some simple pages in markdown, and you're set.</p>
<p>Over time, I've come to appreciate the look of bare HTML with minimal CSS more and more. Javascript is very nice but I personally don't feel compelled to use it for my website. So this is how I made this website with <code>pandoc</code> as a backbone.</p>
<h1 id="using-pandoc-as-a-static-website-generator">Using <code>pandoc</code> as a static website generator</h1>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>I'm treating the source of this website like the source of a C program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSS is like the header files, it defines some shared parameters to be imported and expanded on elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is like the <code>.c</code> files, the bulk of the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And finally, <code>pandoc</code> acts as a compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this familiar setup, of course a <code>Makefile</code> is needed!</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>├── Blog
│   └── {blog posts}.md
├── Project
│   └── {projects}.md
├── Images
│   └── {Images}
├── Makefile
├── index.md
└── pandoc.css</code></pre>
<p>I've written the Makefile so that the compiled %.html lives in the same space as the source %.md. I <del>can't be bothered to change that</del> decided this was a feature, so everything is <del>entirely unsecured</del> open source.</p>
<p>Poke around and see how I implemented things.</p>
