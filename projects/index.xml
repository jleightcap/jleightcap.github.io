      <description>Links Easy use of Markdown. To display a link, the plaintext in *.md [Google](https://www.google.com/) renders as
Google
Code Blocks Add pygmentsUseClasses = true to config.toml. This is default in hermit. To display a code block, the plaintext in *.md renders as
def fibonacci(n):if n &amp;lt;= 1:return nelse:return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)) TeX Can&#39;t use .md, use .mmark as extension of document. Add to header of *.mmark markup = mmark.</description>

      <description>First recording, 6 hours (2017) During my Junior year of high school, I recorded a 6-hour performance of Erik Satie&amp;rsquo;s Vexations.   This was extremely underplanned, and a surprising amount went wrong. I used Windows 10&amp;rsquo;s default camera app with a random webcam, and found - during the recording - Windows Camera had a 2 hour recording limit. Because I was recording audio separately, the audio and video were desynced, so the required merging of the video and audio required some guesswork in matching my fingers to the audio.</description>
