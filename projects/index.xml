      <description>Links Easy use of Markdown. To display a link, the plaintext in *.md [Google](https://www.google.com/) renders as

TeX Can&#39;t use .md, use .mmark as extension of document. Add to header of *.mmark markup = mmark. Add to bottom of footer.html (which is loaded on every page) &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;//yihui.name/js/math-code.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script asyncsrc=&amp;#34;//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; This uses MathJax, but it might be worthwhile to swap to KaTeX for faster rendering.

      <description>First recording, 6 hours (2017) During my Junior year of high school, I recorded a 6-hour performance of Erik Satie&amp;rsquo;s Vexations.   This was extremely underplanned, and a surprising amount went wrong. I used Windows 10&amp;rsquo;s default camera app with a random webcam, and found - during the recording - Windows Camera had a 2 hour recording limit. Because I was recording audio separately, the audio and video were desynced, so the required merging of the video and audio required some guesswork in matching my fingers to the audio.</description>
