      <description>Syntax Highlighting Blocked, {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;gt;}}CODE{{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}} With line numbers, 1 2 3  {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;#34;linenos = table&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}CODE{{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}}   Syntax highlighting a code block including the curly brace pairs is tough. No joke, my solution is to put a ðŸ˜‚ between the curly braces, which is invisible in the syntax highlighting ({ðŸ˜‚{&amp;lt; ... &amp;gt;}ðŸ˜‚}). I tried zero-width spaces and escape characters, but this huge bodge is a great functional use of emoji.</description>

      <description>First recording, 6 hours (2017) During my Junior year of high school, I recorded a 6-hour performance of Erik Satie&amp;rsquo;s Vexations.   This was extremely underplanned, and a surprising amount went wrong. I used Windows 10&amp;rsquo;s default camera app with a random webcam, and found - during the recording - Windows Camera had a 2 hour recording limit. Because I was recording audio separately, the audio and video were desynced, so the required merging of the video and audio required some guesswork in matching my fingers to the audio.</description>

      <description>Using a brute force Traveling Salesman search of the MBTA Green Line, I found the shortest possible route which visits all 64 stops. The ideal time was about 3 hours. In practice, my best time is 3:15.   The search involved reducing the graph to a 6-node non-directed graph search. All paths start and end at the most extreme ends, Lechmere and Riverside respectively. Directionality was determined based on MBTA early morning time tables.</description>
