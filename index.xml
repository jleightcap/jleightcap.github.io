      <description>Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology One of the handful of museums within a 5 minute walk of Pembroke College, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&amp;rsquo;s most interesting exhibit was about the local area. I&amp;rsquo;d never bothered to look up why, but the College/University system at Cambridge is really distinct from the American system where &amp;ldquo;College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;University&amp;rdquo; are used almost interchangeably (&amp;ldquo;Boston College&amp;rdquo; lying to you twice is a good example of the distinction).</description>

      <description>Background Before even going into my first year at Northeastern, I wanted to do a study abroad during my first summer. The timing is perfect, all my future summers at Northeastern will be mostly filled with co-op or engineering classes. Throughout the entire search for a study abroad program, my focus was on having the classes I would take count for as much as possible.
During my second semester, I was deciding between programs at Oxford and Cambridge, but decided on the Pembroke-Kings Programme (PKP) at Cambridge.</description>

      <description>Syntax Highlighting Blocked, {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;gt;}} CODE {{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}} With line numbers, 1 2 3  {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;#34;linenos = table&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} CODE {{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}}   Syntax highlighting a code block including the curly brace pairs is tough. No joke, my solution is to put a ðŸ˜‚ between the curly braces, which is invisible in the syntax highlighting ({ðŸ˜‚{&amp;lt; ... &amp;gt;}ðŸ˜‚}). I tried zero-width spaces and escape characters, but this huge bodge is a great functional use of emoji.</description>

      <description>First recording, 6 hours (2017) During my Junior year of high school, I recorded a 6-hour performance of Erik Satie&amp;rsquo;s Vexations.   This was extremely underplanned, and a surprising amount went wrong. I used Windows 10&amp;rsquo;s default camera app with a random webcam, and found - during the recording - Windows Camera had a 2 hour recording limit. Because I was recording audio separately, the audio and video were desynced, so the required merging of the video and audio required some guesswork in matching my fingers to the audio.</description>

      <title>Charlie &#39;the Traveling Salesman&#39; on the MBTA</title>

      <description>Using a brute force Traveling Salesman search of the MBTA Green Line, I found the shortest possible route which visits all 64 stops. The ideal time was about 3 hours. In practice, my best time is 3:15.   The search involved reducing the graph to a 6-node non-directed graph search. All paths start and end at the most extreme ends, Lechmere and Riverside respectively. Directionality was determined based on MBTA early morning time tables.</description>
