<p>As a bit of a reiteration of my first post, this study abroad was through the <em>Pembroke-King's Programme</em>, a six-week program(mme) that runs from early July into mid-August.
At least for Northeastern, this runs about halfway through summer break until about a week or two before the start of the fall semester.
The classes provided were an opportunity to finish all of my humanities requirements early into college (see the post about classes for more details), and while this definitely does have its benefits, it lead to a kind of mixed experience.
First, I mostly picked both my classes and this program with the intention of filling these completely arbitrary requirements &ndash; and this lead to me not really picking classes based on personal interest.</p>
<p>The first hurdle I really experienced in terms of academics was just the sheer amount of reading that needed to be done on a daily basis.
As I think I've  mentioned before in these blogs, I really have been wanting to get back into reading, and this was not any kind of gentle reintroduction which I do appreciate.
This became overwhelming at some points, definitely.</p>
<p>This transitions into a big point for classes at Cambridge (and more generally in the UK, as I've been told, but don't hold me to that).
It seems like a very &lsquo;American&rsquo; thing (again speaking broadly) to test constantly &ndash; the result of this is that it takes a very short time to fall behind, and what you get from the class is probably a pretty even spread of topics across the syllabus.
In contrast, the grades for the classes at Cambridge are only based on a written exam and a final dissertation.
Maybe it's just my upbringing in the former test-heavy environment, but my work ethic throughout the classes was much more a falling into habit of trying to stay &lsquo;up-to-date&rsquo; on my readings.
But, I think a much more helpful mindset would be to cater to the examination style.
When writing the dissertations, very few of the readings actually had any direct influence on the research process.
Rather, a more efficient use of time would've been to be familiar with all of the readings, but decide a dissertation and exam topic early on and really focus on those ideas.
I think treating every subject in both classes as a possible dissertation topic ended up wasting a lot of time overall.</p>
<p>Since I'm about to go back to Northeastern and of course start my very STEM-heavy courseload again, reflecting on the classes I took really makes me enjoy the classes I'm taking even more.
I learned more in having to write dissertations than I could've imagined, and I'm sure improving my writing skills from their atrophied maybe 10th-grade state can't hurt, but I'm very glad to be going back to my comfort zone of problem sets and concrete answers in finite time.</p>
<p>While a lot of what I've written about is pretty similar to the Classes blog post, I think it's been interesting reflecting on the program instead of just summarizing my experiences during the program.</p>
<h4 id="history-of-the-modern-middle-east">History of the Modern Middle East<a href="#history-of-the-modern-middle-east" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>As a recount for both of these classes, I don't think I could've been luckier in just taking classes just based on graduation requirements.
From the outset, I loved the professor for this class.
I really appreciate people who have an intense interest in extremely specific things, and this professor definitely gave off those same vibes.
The course started in the 1800s (being the Modern Middle East), but had readings that extended all the way back to the beginnings of Islam.
The course extended up into the Arab Spring, but throughout the lectures had moments of extending to current-day conflicts.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this class by far was the last seminar.
The professor about halfway through just asked &ldquo;any questions for me?&quot;, and his insights on anything and everything people brought up was super interesting.
I really enjoyed how much of an emphasis he put on the design of the course, and his insights into teaching in general - just talking about how arbitrary the lines are between different history classes and how they're structured, and how a lot of scholarship done about non-Western places done for most of history is constantly reconsidered.
In general, I have much more of an appreciation for history classes after taking this.</p>
<h4 id="infinite-variety-shakespearean-drama">Infinite Variety Shakespearean Drama<a href="#infinite-variety-shakespearean-drama" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>Why did no one tell me Shakespeare was this interesting before?
Not that my high school English teachers failed me or anything, but my only memories of analyzing Shakespeare in high school were churning out essays in a couple hours.
Maybe it was just the focus of having an entire class dedicated to Shakespeare, but I really enjoyed everything I read.
The professor again was unbelievable, the breadth of his knowledge never ceased to amaze me - if anyone analyzed even the smallest of detail, he'd not only be familiar, but be able to cite entire books or essays that analyzed that exact thing just off of the top of his head.
Again, a professor that is great to talk to just because of how intensely interested he is in English literature.</p>
<h2 id="studying-abroad-in-general-and-personal-experience">Studying Abroad in General and Personal Experience<a href="#studying-abroad-in-general-and-personal-experience" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>The rigor of the classes I took wasn't an issue in and of itself, I probably spend a pretty similar amount of time and effort on classes during the semester at Northeastern, but this was really in direct conflict with the internal and external pressures to do &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; stuff while abroad.
Don't get me wrong, because these classes were just as much work I get credit for them (which was kind of the point of doing a study abroad), but in the context of being required to write this blog, wanting to explore Europe, and family being interested in what my plans were, lead to a lot of beating myself up for time management.
It was demoralizing to have all these plans going in fall apart because I had to focus most of my time on academics &ndash; again, that isn't a failure of the program, rather a failure of judgement on my part.
I originally had plans for every weekend, which ended up being pretty hard to accomplish with the pressure from classes.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my major point of advice if anyone does this program (or a similar one) &ndash; I didn't know a lot people there were taking these classes pass/fail until the very end of the program.
This really explained a lot in hindsight &ndash; I was really intimidated talking to people about how much they traveled &ndash; and just generally did &ndash; outside of classes, and frequently felt inadequate because of it.
Sure, a lot of that might stem from insecurities, but it generally made me feel as if I was disproportionately struggling in these classes because I spent most of my time on academics.
It warrants repeating &ndash; <em>a LOT of people are taking these classes pass/fail</em>.
Some needed context is the grading scale used &ndash; what might be considered failing for some classes I've taken at Northeastern is a passing grade at Cambridge.
For the people that took their classes pass/fail, or generally not for credit, I absolutely don't blame them for putting less emphasis on classes and spending time travelling and being a tourist.
I definitely would've done the same.
When this was brought up to one of my professors towards the end of the program, he was kind of shocked when me and the other people from Northeastern said we were taking the class for credit.</p>
<p>So, a lot of my struggle from this program might've just been because of my ego &ndash; and I'm even hesitant to mention this struggle because it can definitely come off as &ldquo;boo hoo, I might get a B&rdquo; if written in the wrong tone.
But, if you're doing a study abroad, these regrets would definitely be my main takeaway.
Even if you're taking the classes for credit like I did, at least consider that a C is just as passing as an A.</p>
<p>As another reflection, mostly just about the idea of studying abroad during my first summer (especially at Northeastern), I wish I had put more thought into enjoying what is probably going to be my last full summer.
Especially during the gap between this study abroad and going back to classes, it does feel like I've squandered what little time I had at left to spend with my friends in my hometown.</p>
<p>I felt it was important to include that diatribe, but I'll move on to describing some fun things that just didn't fit into a full themed blog post.</p>
<h3 id="travel">Travel<a href="#travel" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<h4 id="edinburgh">Edinburgh<a href="#edinburgh" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>I went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival on my second weekend - I considered making a blog post just for this it was so fun!
I bought tickets specifically for Matt Parker, a stand-up comedian/mathematician who I love.
In fact, he has a book come out recently that's only available in a physical copy in the UK which was a nice coincidence - I made sure to have him sign it!
This is the second time I've seen him in person, this first in the fall semester at Harvard where he gave a talk about math errors &ndash; which eventually became the topic of his book.</p>
<p><img src="/post-images/cambridge/MattParker.jpg" alt="MattParker"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also saw a couple other comedy shows that were free and going on at the time.
Edinburgh was mostly just an exercise in public transit in the UK, I really only ended up spending about 3 hours in the city before heading back.</p>
<h4 id="cardiff">Cardiff<a href="#cardiff" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>I took the train into Cardiff on a whim and really enjoyed it &ndash; I honestly have no idea what a tourist would want to see in Cardiff so I just kind of mumbled around the city for a couple hours.
I really enjoyed it, it's a city I was never really recommended to see but I ended up loving it.
My phone was pretty low on battery at dusk so I don't have any nice pictures to share.</p>
<h4 id="london">London<a href="#london" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>I already briefly mentioned my trips into London, but I ended up going to London more and more as the program went on, maybe about fifteen times in total.
I really loved London, I could see myself living there.
It seems like the perfect blend of Boston and New York City.</p>
<p><img src="/post-images/cambridge/London.jpg" alt="London"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Going into London the first time being unfamiliar with the public transit, I planned a ridiculous amount of time just in case something went wrong or I got lost.
By the end of the program if I had more than three hours free I'd jump at the opportunity to go into London.</p>
<h4 id="ely">Ely<a href="#ely" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>A really small town just north of Cambridge, really quaint with a lot of similar Gothic architecture to Cambridge.
Maybe it was just being desensitized by seeing King's Chapel every day, but I wasn't as floored as I probably should've been giving how pretty the city was.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food<a href="#food" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>I was pretty frugal about eating out, but the food in Cambridge and London was fantastic.
There are so many restaurants in and around the city that I really didn't even eat at a fraction of what was available.</p>
<p>I of course have to mention Sainsbury's &ndash; as far as I can tell it's roughly equivalent to 711 &ndash; which means I instantly liked it.</p>
<p>London was the true highlight, and I made sure to eat somewhere and eat somewhere new every time I went. For a quick reference, I used Tom Scott and Matt Gray's <a href="https://youtu.be/nOQNAzvZQnA">Places to eat in London</a> as Bible.</p>
