<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking two classes while I&rsquo;m at Cambridge - <em>History of the Modern Middle East</em> and <em>Shakespearean Drama</em>.
There were some more &lsquo;traditionally&rsquo; STEM classes available, but these two classes at least cover my last two humanities requirements at Northeastern.
I definitely enjoy humanities classes I take, and I think it&rsquo;s important to find a balance in what you learn, but it&rsquo;s definitely a factor for me that these classes compress my humanities requirements into a 6 week period rather than taking up two classes in a ~15 week semester.
As an aside, I have had a change of heart about what classes I take in general throughout my first two semesters that lead me to get my humanities requirements &lsquo;out of the way&rsquo; here.
When I was asking my GEO adviser at Northeastern about what classes I was planning on taking, he jokingly pointed out just how intensely everyone at Northeastern cares about what classes they take - that&rsquo;s certainly been true, and as a result I&rsquo;ve been given some great advice that I&rsquo;m really thankful for early into college.
Maybe it&rsquo;s not a good idea to say this on a blog that&rsquo;s a requirement for a scholarship from Northeastern, but unless you&rsquo;re not paying for your own tuition, as a general rule take as few classes as possible to graduate.</p>

<p>I planned out 8 semesters worth of classes with 3 minors the summer before my freshman year - I had this huge web of classes that would double or triple count for requirements.
In my first two semesters, after not particularly learning anything in the unskippable Cornerstone of Engineering I and II, my view on prerequisites and required classes soured a little.
After asking around, it became even more clear that it&rsquo;s not a hard rule that a class being required means that class is actually going to be worthwhile to learning about that subject.
I looked back on the classes I laid out for the next 3 or 4 years and really asked myself, am I actually interested in this specific class, or do I just want to jump through the arbitrary hoops for the line &ldquo;{x,y,z}, minors&rdquo; on my resume?
My approach to taking classes now is much more dependent on if I think that a class will actually be rigorous and teach me skills that will be useful.
I kind of wish I had this mindset earlier - I can think back on 4 of the 8 classes I&rsquo;ve taken so far at Northeastern and pretty confidently say that I didn&rsquo;t learn as much as I would&rsquo;ve wanted to.
Of course, learning the material and being enthusiastic about the subject is still on me, I don&rsquo;t want to put any blame on my professors.</p>

<p>So, after that long tangent, that explains my mindset in taking my humanities requirements here.
I&rsquo;m getting them out of the ways early in an optional half semester so I can really focus on classes that are going to directly impact my future plans at Northeastern.
Is that going to make me the most well rounded person? Of course not.
But I&rsquo;ll be in a little less debt.</p>

<h2 id="class-setup">Class Setup</h2>

<p>Classes are intense.
All classes have the same setup - 12 lectures and 8 seminars.
Lectures are nothing particularly out of the ordinary, but seminars are somewhat unique to Oxford (where they&rsquo;re called tutorials) and Cambridge.
Both classes have seminars of about 10 people, and the professor pretty much only serves to point conversation, not generate it - more &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a topic, discuss,&rsquo; which makes it immediately and abundantly clear if you did not understand the readings. Hypothetically.</p>

<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>

<p>Every lecture and seminar has an associated reading.
Each lecture and seminar has a reading totaling about 100 pages, which is in stark contrast to the about 0 pages a day average I was reading before starting classes.
It&rsquo;s not uncommon to finish my last class of the day, then read in all my free time up until the first class the next day.
I don&rsquo;t want to make this sound like a bad thing, I&rsquo;ve wanted to get back into the habit of reading, and this is definitely a baptism by fire.</p>

<h3 id="exams-and-dissertations">Exams and Dissertations</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to point out that the last class I had to write a major essay in was probably AP English in my junior year of high school, so saying I&rsquo;m rusty with writing is definitely an understatement.
For people who write much more frequently, I&rsquo;m sure essays are much more welcome - but personally I&rsquo;ll take a problem set any day of the week.
Halfway through the course, classes release a list of about 10 discussion questions, and you answer 2 in less than 1000 words, due in a week.
Doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad considering these blog posts are ~1000 words, but the prompts are extremely detailed.
My draft for both prompts was about 3000 words, and both were cut down to about 950 words each.</p>

<p>Dissertation questions are released early into the course and due in the last week. This is a much more general prompt with a word limit of 2500. I&rsquo;ve been working on both dissertations, and they&rsquo;re still very challenging.</p>

<p>Those 3 essays determine your grade for each course, in stark contrast to my experience throughout high school and college where it seems you&rsquo;re being graded for something every time you blink.
I don&rsquo;t know what system I prefer - at Northeastern I can at least tell if I&rsquo;m not understanding something early on and correct it, but the system here is much more focused on become very well acquainted with one slice of the class rather than being tested lightly on everything.</p>

<h3 id="study-spaces">Study Spaces</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to get work done when there are so many gorgeous places to work.</p>

<p><img src="/post-images/cambridge/Library.jpg" alt="Library" />
<center><strong><em>Pembroke College Library</em></strong></center></p>

<p>The library is open 8am-12am, is rarely crowded, and completely silent.
I want to pick this building up, destroy Snell, and put it in its place.</p>

<p><img src="/post-images/cambridge/Park.jpg" alt="Park" />
<center><strong><em>Chirst&rsquo;s Pieces</em></strong></center></p>

<p>My nightly routine at this point is to get a sausage from a food truck, and read the day&rsquo;s Shakespeare reading in Christ&rsquo;s Pieces park.
Not great for writing, but any park around Cambridge is super nice to read in.</p>

			<description>If you know me, then you know I like classical music to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s almost concerning. So, a fair amount of my evenings here in the UK have unsurprisingly been hanging out with old people listening to classical music.
Because these concerts have been at night, my pictures have been pretty bad. So this post is going to be pretty scant on pictures, sorry.

<p>If you know me, then you know I like classical music to the point where it&rsquo;s almost concerning.
So, a fair amount of my evenings here in the UK have unsurprisingly been hanging out with old people listening to classical music.</p>

<p>Because these concerts have been at night, my pictures have been pretty bad. So this post is going to be pretty scant on pictures, sorry.</p>

<h2 id="cambridge-summer-music-festival">Cambridge Summer Music Festival</h2>

<h3 id="bach-st-john-passion">Bach - <em>St. John Passion</em></h3>

<p>This was the fist concert I went to here, and was the season opener for the <em>Cambridge Summer Music Festival</em>.
I didn&rsquo;t get the booklet with the English translation, so I got to enjoy the Gospel of John for two hours in lovely German that I don&rsquo;t understand.
I still enjoyed it, though.</p>

<h3 id="britten-sinfonia-academy">Britten Sinfonia Academy</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britten_Sinfonia">Britten Sinfonia</a> is very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Far_Cry">A Far Cry</a> in Boston, both being chamber orchestra groups with no &lsquo;leader&rsquo; - all members have equal leadership and they play with no conductor.
A Far Cry frequently collaborates with students at the New England Conservatory, and similarly the Britten Sinfonia has an academy for high school students to get involved in a chamber group.
I didn&rsquo;t know this was going to be a concert played mostly by teenagers, especially when the program included pieces like Ligeti&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/hzKHTadm-PA"><em>Romanian Concerto</em></a> or Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/MdQyN7MYSN8"><em>Overture &lsquo;The Herbrides&rsquo;</em></a> - pieces very far beyond what most high school students would play.</p>

<h3 id="ben-comeau-lunchtime-concert">Ben Comeau Lunchtime Concert</h3>

<p>This was an unexpectedly fun concert.
When buying tickets, there was no announced program, but the blurbs about the pianist were interesting enough and the tickets cheap enough that I decided to go anyway.
I&rsquo;ve noticed in the UK that programs aren&rsquo;t free - any concert I&rsquo;ve been to in the US shoves programs in your face, which makes sense considering they&rsquo;re short novels of advertisements with maybe two pages of program notes.
So, this concert was a game for me of seeing if I could recognize the pieces as he went.
The first was excerpts from Bach&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/PcTVkOzrzQs"><em>The Musical Offering</em></a>, I didn&rsquo;t recognize the second, and the third was Ravels <a href="https://youtu.be/SCKDG7w2S9c"><em>Alborada del Gracioso</em> from <em>Miroirs</em></a>.
As he was playing his main program, he passed around a piece of paper asking for musical themes.</p>

<p>After the first three pieces, he mentioned the second was the premier of a piece he had composed (so I felt better about not knowing it), and collected the list of themes and improvised on them, which was honestly the highlight of the concert.
He started with Hedwig&rsquo;s Theme played as a tango, and of course any improvisation wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without music from Frozen, but there were really neat nods for people in the <em>know</em>, like Claire de Lune played in the style of Ravel&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/b7oJqi52d2I">Scarbo</a>.</p>

<p>I of course requested <a href="https://youtu.be/Gjj9VBcLQJ8">4&rsquo;33&rdquo;</a>, and I assume being an overused and pretty unfunny joke he skipped my suggestion.</p>

<h3 id="brandenburg-concerti">Brandenburg Concerti</h3>

<p>This was the second time I went to a concert of Bach&rsquo;s complete <em>Brandenburg Concerti</em>, and this certainly was a concert of Bach&rsquo;s complete <em>Brandenburg Concerti</em>.
I really don&rsquo;t have much to say about this concert other than finding it really relaxing, so instead I&rsquo;ll share a story from the first concert where I heard these pieces.</p>

<p>There are six concerti, each with three movements.
I went to this concert with my mom and my sister, and my mom being extremely patient with me dragging her to very long concerts of music that she isn&rsquo;t extremely interested in, started putting her coat on after the last movement of the second Concerto.
It took me a second to understand, and I still look back on that and laugh.
I try to remember that when people don&rsquo;t follow the right &lsquo;etiquette&rsquo; at concerts - not everyone is as &lsquo;ingrained&rsquo; in classical music, and it&rsquo;s not good to fall into elitism about people not knowing things about it - like the difference between a movement and a Concerto.</p>

<h3 id="goldberg-variations">Goldberg Variations</h3>

<p>This is my second time listening to the Goldberg Variations in Cambridge!
Just a different one this time.
Christopher Taylor  played the Goldberg Variations at Longy School of Music of Bard College last December, along with Rzewski&rsquo;s <em>The People United Will Never Be Defeated</em> (which is still one of the best concerts I&rsquo;ve been to).</p>

<p>Bach&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/Ah392lnFHxM">Goldberg Variations</a> are definitely something you can listen to over and over again and always find something new to like.
I left this concert with the last variation stuck in my head, which is one that never really stuck with me before.</p>

<h2 id="bbc-proms">BBC Proms</h2>

<p>The BBC Proms are probably the things I&rsquo;ve most looked forward to here.
I was impatient and bought tickets before my class schedule came out, so I have had to skip some concerts, but I have been to one so far - Proms 8, <em>Invitation to the Dance</em> at Royal Albert Hall in London.</p>

<p><img src="/post-images/cambridge/Hall.jpeg" alt="Royal Albert Hall" />
<center><strong><em>There&rsquo;s no way I could take a picture this nice - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Proms">Image Source</a></em></strong> </center></p>

<p>The program  was Debussy&rsquo;s <em>Prélude à l&rsquo;après-midi d&rsquo;un faune</em>, Barók&rsquo;s <em>Dance Suite</em>, a violin concerto composed by the conductor Péter Eötvös, and Stravinsky&rsquo;s <em>The Firebird</em>.</p>

<p>The Debussy is one of my favorite pieces, and for anyone that likes Impressionism the two pieces I really love from the period are Debussy&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/X7rtImnDkEc"><em>Prélude à l&rsquo;après midi d&rsquo;un faune</em></a> and Ravel&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/sYNlYMvFA5U"><em>Daphnis et Chloé</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="jack-gibbons-oxford-series">Jack Gibbons Oxford Series</h2>

<p>Jack Gibbons is a pianist that I found through YouTube, and will take any opportunity to see play.
I found him through his performances of Alkan, a composer who experienced a kind of revival in the 1970s, and Jack Gibbons at the age of 17 gave the second ever complete performance of Alkan&rsquo;s complete <a href="https://youtu.be/6-YXdfKK4J0"><em>Concerto for Solo Piano</em></a>.</p>

<p>I first saw him play the Gershwin <a href="https://youtu.be/ghEa1x23low"><em>Concerto in F</em></a> in  New Jersey, but this concert was <em>The Life of Chopin</em>, unsurprisingly about Chopin.
There was a really good mix of Chopin&rsquo;s more large-scale pieces like the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/8QT7ITv9Ecs"><em>&ldquo;Heroic&rdquo; Polonaise</em></a> and the smaller Etudes, Mazurkas, and Waltzes.</p>

<p>He plays these concerts every year at the Holywell Music Room at Oxford, which is surprisingly difficult to get to from Cambridge, especially when trying to get back to Cambridge at 10pm. Even though Cambridge and Oxford are pretty close if you drive, for public transportation you have to go through London. I ended up checking into an Airbnb about 15 minutes after booking it.</p>

			<description>Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology One of the handful of museums within a 5 minute walk of Pembroke College, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&amp;rsquo;s most interesting exhibit was about the local area. I&amp;rsquo;d never bothered to look up why, but the College/University system at Cambridge is really distinct from the American system where &amp;ldquo;College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;University&amp;rdquo; are used almost interchangeably (&amp;ldquo;Boston College&amp;rdquo; lying to you twice is a good example of the distinction).</description>

<h2 id="museum-of-archaeology-and-anthropology">Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</h2>

<p>One of the handful of museums within a 5 minute walk of Pembroke College, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&rsquo;s most interesting exhibit was about the local area.
I&rsquo;d never bothered to look up why, but the College/University system at Cambridge is really distinct from the American system where &ldquo;College&rdquo; and &ldquo;University&rdquo; are used almost interchangeably (&ldquo;Boston College&rdquo; lying to you twice is a good example of the distinction).
With objects from the founding of the early colleges at Cambridge, the exhibit mentioned the conflict between the scholars with royal protections and the locals causing the need for the castle-like colleges.
The colleges all have the layout of walled monasteries, with individual living spaces surrounding an open courtyard, a grand hall, a chapel, and a library to keep their knowledge safe.
This caries through to today, where I have to use a keycard to access the college past 7pm when the large, oak doors lock.</p>

<h2 id="the-fitzwilliam-museum">The Fitzwilliam Museum</h2>

<p>The Fitzwilliam Museum is eerily similar to the MFA.
There&rsquo;s the modernist sculpture on the lawns, the tacky gift shop and cafe, the pillars -  it all felt very familiar.
There are two special exhibits on display while I&rsquo;m here - the Beggarstaffs poster exhibition and an exhibition of paper fans.
Both exhibitions showed how a medium considered fairly mundane can be elevated to a fine art, and the fans were particularly interesting because of their connection to origami.</p>

<h2 id="sedgwick-museum-of-earth-sciences">Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences</h2>

<p>A very large building filled with many rocks. I had fun looking at rocks for about half an hour before I decided I had seen enough rocks.
There&rsquo;s a small room at the end of the long, main exhibition that focused on crystals.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/Museum1.jpg" alt="test" />
<center><strong><em>AP Chemistry memories</em></strong></center></p>

<p>The pretty colors and little models are much more my speed.</p>

<h2 id="scott-polar-research-institute-polar-museum">Scott Polar Research Institute (Polar Museum)</h2>

<p>This has been one of my favorite museums so far.
I walked by it on my way to my dorm on my first day here, not having heard of it before.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/Museum4.jpg" alt="test" />
<center><strong><em>One of the two entrance domes, with an antique map of each pole</em></strong></center></p>

<p>Half of the museum was a timeline of Arctic exploration, and the other half was a timeline of Antarctic exploration.
It took about 2 hours total to walk through both halves, and by the end of each half you really get a good sense of the characters and scale of both explorations.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/Museum3.jpg" alt="test" />
<center><strong><em>no booping was allowed</em></strong></center></p>

<p>I also really liked the memorial to sled dogs.</p>

<h2 id="cambridge-museum-of-technology">Cambridge Museum of Technology</h2>

<p>This was another museum that I just happened to stumble across.
The museum is a renovated decommissioned sewage pump station, and is a museum for just that.
It gives a history from early Cambridge when sewage was dumped into the River Cam to efforts to follow London in modernizing sewage treatment.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/Museum5.jpg" alt="test" /></p>

<p>The museum also includes a separate building dedicated to the history of manufacturing in Cambridge which reminded me of the history of Westinghouse.</p>

<h2 id="the-centre-for-computing-history">The Centre for Computing History</h2>

<p>This has definitely been my favorite museum I&rsquo;ve visited.
You first walk into the building and see the &ldquo;Megaprocessor&rdquo;, a microprocessor built to the scale of a large, hobbyist transistor.
Every logic gate is built from these large transistors, and these build up to the ALU, I/O, and all the way up to structured  Opcode and a playable game of Tetris.
This all includes extensive documentation, and I really could&rsquo;ve spent all day trying to map out each piece.
The creator is doing a Q/A at the museum later this month, and I definitely plan to visit at least a few more times.<br />
<br />
The next room has computers free to mess around on from the 1960s up to modern PCs. There was a book on BBC Micro programming, so of course I had to at least figure out
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">

</div>
</div></p>

<p>The last exhibit was focused on biographies of people involved in the computer revolution, with a focus on women that have been historically underrepresented in the history of computer science.
There&rsquo;s even a portrait of Zucc hanging ominously over you to really complete the experience.</p>

<h2 id="whipple-museum-of-the-history-of-science">Whipple Museum of the History of Science</h2>

<p>This museum has the interesting goal of documenting the historical aspect of science, which mostly focused on teaching aides and antique lab equipment.
It included an entire exhibit for globes, Darwin&rsquo;s microscopes, and even had number pseudo-scientific equipment on display, like a glorified Wheatstone bridge from the Church of Scientology that claims to measure thoughts.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/Museum2.jpg" alt="Atwood Machine" />
<center><strong><em>AP Physics memories</em></strong></center></p>

<p>It even included an early Atwood Machine, which if you&rsquo;ve ever learned about masses on a pulley or an expression like
<code>\[ \vec{a} = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\vec{g} \]</code>
then you&rsquo;ll appreciate this as much as I did.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Before even going into my first year at Northeastern, I wanted to do a study abroad during my first summer.
The timing is perfect, all my future summers at Northeastern will be mostly filled with co-op or engineering classes.
Throughout the entire search for a study abroad program, my focus was on having the classes I would take count for as much as possible.<br />
During my second semester, I was deciding between programs at Oxford and Cambridge, but decided on the Pembroke-Kings Programme (PKP) at Cambridge.
I&rsquo;m taking two classes (half a semester), <em>History of the Modern Middle East</em> and <em>Shakespearean Drama</em>, which fill my last two humanities requirements at Northeastern. I&rsquo;m going to make a whole post later in the program about these classes, and why I chose them.<br />
Without getting into the weird specific details of who I&rsquo;m paying for what and how much, my costs for this program are covered by my Dean&rsquo;s Scholarship and a GEO (Global Experience Office) Grant from Northeastern, and the YGL Scholarship from the Northeastern <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/ygl/about-us/">Young Global Leaders</a>, an alumni group for &ldquo;the globalization of [Northeastern].&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-cambridge">Getting to Cambridge</h2>

<p>I flew from Newark to London Stansted with a layover in Copenhagen on SAS.
Getting a train from Stansted to Cambridge was extremely streamlined, it probably wasn&rsquo;t even necessary to buy my ticket in advance.
The public transportation around the entire area is fantastic, and in the future it&rsquo;s probably just as easy to fly to Heathrow or another larger airport and get to Cambridge.</p>

<h2 id="dorms">Dorms</h2>

<p>There are a couple different &lsquo;bands&rsquo; of housing available on the program.
The cheapest housing band was filled by the time I submitted my deposit, so I&rsquo;m in the second cheapest housing option, and a week into the program I&rsquo;m still genuinely shocked at how nice all of the rooms are.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/cambridge1-1.jpg" alt="Room1" />
<center><strong><em>Room in Pembroke College</em></strong></center></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m living at Pembroke College, in the dorm next to the Pembroke Chapel and across from the Pembroke Library.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/cambridge1-2.jpg" alt="Room2" />
<center><strong><em>View of Pembroke Library from my window</em></strong></center></p>

<h2 id="the-local-area">The Local Area</h2>

<p>Pembroke College is absolutely gorgeous.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/cambridge1-3.jpg" alt="Campus1" />
<center><strong><em>View of Old Court and the Porter&rsquo;s Lodge</em></strong></center></p>

<p>There are too many courts, lawns, orchards, and greens to take pictures of.
Unlike Northeastern where it&rsquo;s an advertising point to talk about &lsquo;hanging out on Centennial Common&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Urban Oasis&rsquo; of Boston, there is a <em>strict</em> policy of not stepping on the grass at Cambridge, to the point where there are signs everywhere, <em>in multiple languages</em>, telling people not to step on the grass.<br />
<br />
<img src="/post-images/cambridge/cambridge1-4.jpg" alt="Campus2" />
<center><strong><em>View of dorm, Pembroke Chappel, and Pembroke Library from the Library Lawn</em></strong></center></p>

<p>I really wanted to include a picture of the gigantic hall where we eat, but pictures aren&rsquo;t allowed while students are eating and it&rsquo;s locked otherwise. There are &lsquo;official&rsquo; pictures of the Formal Halls sent later, so I&rsquo;ll include those pictures when I get them.</p>

<h2 id="cambridge-the-city">Cambridge (the city)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my time so far just wandering around Cambridge, and in a lot of ways it really reminds me of downtown Boston.
Old North Church surrounded by huge glass buildings is similar to churches from the 1300s next door to a Caffè Nero or Pizza Hut.
Being a college town, there&rsquo;s also the overwhelming amount of cafes and places to get coffee, to the point where I could probably get coffee from a different place every morning I&rsquo;m here.
There&rsquo;s also the similar tiny streets and sidewalks flooded with tourists, which is something I didn&rsquo;t miss.
Even the Fitzwilliam Museum within view of Pembroke College really reminds me of the MFA, even down to the free admission and modern art on the lawn (although not as iconic as the baby heads).<br />
Speaking of museums, my next post will be about what museums I&rsquo;ve visited.
Thanks for reading!</p>

			<description>Syntax Highlighting Blocked, {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;gt;}} CODE {{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}} With line numbers, 1 2 3  {{&amp;lt; highlight LANGUAGE &amp;#34;linenos = table&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} CODE {{&amp;lt; / highlight &amp;gt;}}   Syntax highlighting a code block including the curly brace pairs is tough. No joke, my solution is to put a 😂 between the curly braces, which is invisible in the syntax highlighting ({😂{&amp;lt; ... &amp;gt;}😂}). I tried zero-width spaces and escape characters, but this huge bodge is a great functional use of emoji.</description>

<h2 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h2>

<p>Blocked,
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-Go" data-lang="Go"><span class="p">{{&lt;</span> <span class="nx">highlight</span> <span class="nx">LANGUAGE</span> <span class="p">&gt;}}</span>

<span class="p">{{&lt;</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nx">highlight</span> <span class="p">&gt;}}</span></code></pre></div>
With line numbers,
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-Go" data-lang="Go"><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2

<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-Go" data-lang="Go"><span class="p">{{&lt;</span> <span class="nx">highlight</span> <span class="nx">LANGUAGE</span> <span class="s">&#34;linenos = table&#34;</span> <span class="p">&gt;}}</span>
<span class="nx">CODE</span>
<span class="p">{{&lt;</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nx">highlight</span> <span class="p">&gt;}}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div>
Syntax highlighting a code block including the curly brace pairs is tough. No joke, my solution is to put a 😂 between the curly braces, which is invisible in the syntax highlighting (<code>{😂{&lt; ... &gt;}😂}</code>). I tried zero-width spaces and escape characters, but this huge bodge is a great functional use of emoji. It&rsquo;s also a great chance to reflect your personality in a write-up with 💩, for example.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>Easy use of Markdown. To display a link, the plaintext in <code>*.md</code>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">[<span class="nt">Google</span>](<span class="na">https://www.google.com/</span>)</code></pre></div>
renders as<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2 id="tex">TeX</h2>

<p>Add to <code>footer.html</code> which is loaded on every page,
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;//yihui.name/js/math-code.js&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">async</span>
  <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
This uses MathJax, but it might be worthwhile to swap to KaTeX for faster rendering.</p>

<h3 id="math-mode">Math Mode</h3>

<p>To display Math Mode TeX, the plaintext in <code>*.md</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-LaTeX" data-lang="LaTeX">`<span class="sb">\[</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\vec</span><span class="nb">{</span><span class="nv">\nabla</span><span class="nb">} </span><span class="nv">\cdot</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\vec</span><span class="nb">{E} </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="m">0</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="s">\]</span>`

<p>renders as
<code>\[ \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E} = 0 \]</code>
<code>\[ \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \]</code>
<code>\[ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{E} = - \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \]</code>
<code>\[ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} \]</code></p>

<h3 id="in-line">In-Line</h3>

<p>To display in-line TeX, the plaintext in <code>*.md</code>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-TeX" data-lang="TeX">The equation for eigenvalues is `<span class="s">\(</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\det</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">\lambda</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\textbf</span><span class="nb">{I} </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="nv">\textbf</span><span class="nb">{A}</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb"> </span><span class="m">0</span><span class="s">\)</span>`, neat huh?</code></pre></div>
renders as<br />
The equation for eigenvalues is <code>\( \det(\lambda \textbf{I} - \textbf{A}) = 0\)</code>, neat huh?</p>

<h2 id="images">Images</h2>

<p>Images are accessed from the <code>./static/</code> directory.
It seems better organized to make a subdirectory with the title,
so in this case within <code>./static/post-images/template</code> is an image <code>EMWave.png</code>. GIFs use the same format, so equivalently use GIF <code>EMWave.gif</code>.
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">![<span class="nt">Image Text</span>](<span class="na">/post-images/template/EMWave.png</span>)</code></pre></div>
renders as
<img src="/post-images/template/EMWave.png" alt="Image Text" /></p>

<h3 id="image-backgrounds">Image Backgrounds</h3>

<p>Add to <a href="https://hugo-theme-hermit.netlify.com/posts/creating-a-new-theme/#front-matter">front matter</a> of <code>*.md</code>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">images:
  - /post-images/template/EMWave.png</code></pre></div>
This uses a local image, but equivalently replace with a URL.</p>

<h2 id="embedded-youtube-videos">Embedded YouTube videos</h2>

<p>For a YouTube video URL <a href="https://youtu.be/rB83DpBJQsE">https://youtu.be/rB83DpBJQsE</a>, use the video ID (rB83DpBJQsE) and youtube.com/embed to make an embedded YouTube player. If just using an iframe, the video looks fine on desktop, but exceeds the text for small widths. To fix this, the size of the embedded video changes. This uses CSS, so in <code>config.toml</code> add <code>customCSS = [&quot;css/videos.css&quot;]</code>, where the file <code>videos.css</code> contains
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-CSS" data-lang="CSS"><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">video-container</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">position</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">relative</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">padding-bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">56.25</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">padding-top</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">overflow</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">hidden</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">video-container</span> <span class="nt">iframe</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">video-container</span> <span class="nt">object</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">video-container</span> <span class="nt">embed</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">position</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">absolute</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">top</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">left</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>
This adds the CSS necessary, so
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-HTML" data-lang="HTML"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;video-container&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

  <span class="na">allowfullscreen</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">iframe</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
renders as
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rB83DpBJQsE"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div></p>

<h2 id="emoji">Emoji</h2>

<p>Finally something important: <code>:EMOJI:</code>, <code>joy</code>=😂, <code>poop</code>=💩, etc.</p>
