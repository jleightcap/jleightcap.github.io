<p>Using a brute force Traveling Salesman, I found the shortest possible route which visits all 64 stops of the MBTA Green Line.</p>

<p>The ideal time was about 2:30. In practice, my best time is 2:47. My first attempt had a time of 3:15, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LspT5B-S-uw">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Instead of searching all 64 nodes, the search instead reduced the graph to a 6-node non-directed graph search. The consequence of a reduction like this is that the edges of the graph then contain stations themselves — this means that the traditional Travelling Salesman problem of visiting every node is modified to visit every node <em>and</em> visit every edge.</p>
<p>To reduce search time, all paths start and end at the most extreme ends, Lechmere and Riverside respectively. Directionality was determined based on MBTA early morning time tables.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-route">The Final Route</h2>
<pre><code>Lechmere → Heath Street → walk to Brookline Village → Hynes → Cleveland Circle → walk to Boston College → Kenmore → Riverside</code></pre>
<p>If you find a more efficient route or beat my record, please let me know!</p>
