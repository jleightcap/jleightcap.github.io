<h1>Charlie 'the Traveling Salesman' on the MBTA</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using a brute force Traveling Salesman, I found the shortest possible route which visits all 64 stops of the MBTA Green Line.</p>
<center><img src="mbtaspeedrun.gif" width="80%"></center>
<p>The ideal time was about 2:30.
In practice, my best time is 2:47.
My first attempt had a time of 3:15, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LspT5B-S-uw">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Instead of searching all 64 nodes, the search instead reduced the graph to a 6-node non-directed graph search.
The consequence of a reduction like this is that the edges of the graph then
contain stations themselves — this means that the traditional Travelling
Salesman problem of visiting every node is modified to visit every node <em>and</em>
visit every edge.</p>
<p>To reduce search time, all paths start and end at the most extreme ends, Lechmere and Riverside respectively.
Directionality was determined based on MBTA early morning time tables.</p>
<h2>The Final Route</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lechmere →</li>
<li>Heath Street →</li>
<li>walk to Brookline Village →</li>
<li>Hynes Convention Center →</li>
<li>Cleveland Circle →</li>
<li>walk to Boston College →</li>
<li>Kenmore →</li>
<li>Riverside</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find a more efficient route or beat my record, please let me know!</p>
